        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains what personal data we collect from you and how we use it.</p>
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect information to provide better services to our users. We collect information in the following ways:</p>

        <h2>Information We Share</h2>
